Optimizing Database Design: Beyond Basic Normalization 🚀🔬

Hey data wizards! 🧙‍♂️ Ready to take your database skills to the next level? Let's explore some advanced techniques that'll make your databases sing! 🎵

Temporal Data Modeling: Time-Traveling with Your Data ⏳🕰️

Imagine if your database could remember the past and predict the future. That's what temporal data modeling is all about!

Key Concepts:

Valid Time: When data is true in the real world 🌍
Transaction Time: When data is recorded in the database 💾
Bitemporal Modeling: Tracking both valid and transaction time 🔄

Example: Employee Salary History


CREATE TABLE EmployeeSalaryHistory (
    EmployeeID INT,
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    ValidFrom DATE,
    ValidTo DATE,
    TransactionStart TIMESTAMP,
    TransactionEnd TIMESTAMP
);

This table lets you track an employee's salary over time, including when changes were made. Time travel, but for data! 🚀
